# ClusterIP

So far, our journey has taken us from running single containers with Docker to deploying applications like NGINX within a Kubernetes cluster. We even learned how to expose these applications to the outside world using a `LoadBalancer` service, giving them an external IP address accessible over the internet.

However, applications are rarely monolithic. Modern systems often consist of multiple interconnected components. Think of a web application: it might have a frontend web server, a backend API, and a database. These components need to communicate with each other *inside* the cluster, not necessarily expose themselves externally. This is where the `ClusterIP` service type comes into play.

## Why Pods Need Help Talking to Each Other

You might wonder, "Can't my pods just talk directly using their IP addresses?" While every pod in Kubernetes gets its own unique IP address, relying on these directly is problematic. Pods are designed to be ephemeral â€“ they can be created, destroyed, rescheduled, or replaced by Kubernetes at any moment (for example, during updates or node failures). When a pod is replaced, its IP address changes.

Imagine your frontend application trying to talk to a backend pod using its specific IP. If that backend pod crashes and gets replaced, the frontend now has an invalid IP address and communication breaks. We need a more stable way for pods to find and talk to each other, regardless of the individual pod IPs.

## Introducing the ClusterIP Service

A `ClusterIP` service provides a stable, internal IP address and a corresponding DNS name within the Kubernetes cluster. This service acts as a consistent entry point for a set of pods that provide a particular function (like our hypothetical database).

When you create a `ClusterIP` service, Kubernetes assigns it an IP address that is *only* reachable from within the cluster. It then continuously monitors pods that match the service's selector (based on labels, just like with `LoadBalancer` services). When traffic arrives at the ClusterIP service's internal IP address or DNS name, Kubernetes intelligently forwards it to one of the healthy, ready pods backing that service.

Think of it like an internal phone extension directory for your company. Instead of dialing a specific person's direct line (which might change if they move offices), you dial a fixed extension for a department (like 'Sales' or 'Support'), and the phone system automatically connects you to an available person in that department. The `ClusterIP` service is that fixed internal extension for your pods.

## ClusterIP vs. LoadBalancer

It's crucial to understand the difference:

*   **LoadBalancer:** Creates an *external* IP address. Its primary purpose is to expose your application to traffic originating *outside* the Kubernetes cluster (e.g., users on the internet).

*   **ClusterIP:** Creates an *internal* IP address. Its primary purpose is to enable communication *between* pods and services *within* the Kubernetes cluster. It is not directly accessible from outside the cluster.

`ClusterIP` is actually the default service type if you don't specify one in your service definition.

## Lab: Connecting Pods Internally

Let's put this into practice. We'll set up a simple MySQL database pod and expose it internally using a `ClusterIP` service. Then, we'll launch a separate Ubuntu pod, install the MySQL client tools inside it, and connect to our database using the internal service name.

### Setting Up the MySQL Backend

First, we need a Deployment to run our MySQL database. Create a file named `mysql-deployment.yaml`:

```yaml
# mysql-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mysql-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1 # Start with one MySQL instance
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mysql
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mysql
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mysql
        image: mysql:8.0 # Use the official MySQL 8.0 image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3306 # MySQL default port
        env:
        - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
          value: "verysecret" # WARNING: Use secrets in production!
```

This YAML defines a Deployment named `mysql-deployment`. It ensures one replica (pod) running the `mysql:8.0` image is always available. Crucially, it labels the pods it creates with `app: mysql` and sets the root password via an environment variable (remember, using plain text passwords here is just for lab simplicity; use Kubernetes Secrets in real applications).

Apply this configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f mysql-deployment.yaml
```

Verify the pod starts up:

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=mysql
```

Wait until the status shows `Running`.

### Exposing MySQL Internally with ClusterIP

Now, let's create the `ClusterIP` service to provide a stable internal endpoint for our MySQL pod. Create a file named `mysql-service.yaml`:

```yaml
# mysql-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysql-service # This name will be used for internal DNS
spec:
  selector:
    app: mysql # Forward traffic to Pods with this label
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 3306       # Port the service listens on
      targetPort: 3306 # Port the container listens on
  # type: ClusterIP # This is the default, so it's optional
```

This defines a Service named `mysql-service`. The key parts are:

*   `selector: app: mysql`: This tells the service to find pods with the label `app: mysql` (which our Deployment creates).

*   `ports`: It maps port `3306` on the service to `targetPort: 3306` on the pods.

*   `type: ClusterIP`: Although omitted here because it's the default, this specifies the service type.

Apply the service configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f mysql-service.yaml
```

Verify the service is created and gets an internal `CLUSTER-IP`:

```bash
kubectl get service mysql-service
```

You'll see output similar to this (the `CLUSTER-IP` will be different):

```
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
mysql-service   ClusterIP   10.100.50.12   <none>        3306/TCP   1m
```
Notice the `TYPE` is `ClusterIP` and `EXTERNAL-IP` is `<none>`.

### Creating a Client Pod

Now we need another pod from which we can test the connection to our MySQL service. We'll use a basic Ubuntu image and keep it running. Create a file named `ubuntu-client-pod.yaml`:

```yaml
# ubuntu-client-pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ubuntu-client
spec:
  containers:
  - name: ubuntu
    image: ubuntu:latest
    command: ["/bin/sleep", "infinity"]
```

Apply this definition:

```bash
kubectl apply -f ubuntu-client-pod.yaml
```

Verify the client pod is running:

```bash
kubectl get pod ubuntu-client
```

### Testing the Internal Connection

Once the `ubuntu-client` pod is `Running`, let's get a shell inside it:

```bash
kubectl exec -it ubuntu-client -- /bin/bash
```

You are now inside the Ubuntu container running within your Kubernetes cluster. First, update the package list and install the MySQL client tools:

```bash
# Inside the ubuntu-client pod
apt-get update && apt-get install -y mysql-client
```

Now, the crucial step: connect to the MySQL database. We don't use the pod's direct IP or the `CLUSTER-IP` address. Instead, we use the *service name* (`mysql-service`) we defined. Kubernetes provides internal DNS resolution, meaning pods can find services by their names.

```bash
# Inside the ubuntu-client pod
# Use the service name 'mysql-service' as the host
# Use the password we set in the deployment 'verysecret'
mysql -h mysql-service -u root -pverysecret
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should be greeted with the MySQL command-line prompt:

```
mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
[...]
mysql>
```

Success! You have connected from one pod (`ubuntu-client`) to another (`mysql-deployment-*`) via the internal `ClusterIP` service (`mysql-service`).

You can run a simple command to verify further:

```sql
-- Inside the mysql prompt
SHOW DATABASES;
exit
```

Finally, exit the shell in the Ubuntu pod:

```bash
# Inside the ubuntu-client pod
exit
```

### Cleaning Up the Lab

To remove the resources we created for this lab, delete the pod, deployment, and service:

```bash
kubectl delete pod ubuntu-client
kubectl delete service mysql-service
kubectl delete deployment mysql-deployment
```

## Summary

The `ClusterIP` service type is fundamental for enabling communication *between* different components of your application running within the same Kubernetes cluster. It provides a stable internal IP address and DNS name, decoupling services from the ephemeral nature of individual pods. By using `ClusterIP` services, you can build robust, multi-component applications where parts can reliably find and communicate with each other, forming the backbone of microservice architectures within Kubernetes.
