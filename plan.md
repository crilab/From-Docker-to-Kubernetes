## What is a Pod?
- Definition and purpose of a pod in Kubernetes
- Difference between containers and pods
- Comparison to Docker containers

## Why Use Single-Container Pods?
- Use cases for single-container vs. multi-container pods
- Simplicity and isolation in design

## Creating a Pod with kubectl
- Basic `kubectl run` example (ubuntu)
- Inspecting pod status with `kubectl get pods`
- Viewing logs with `kubectl logs`

## Interacting with a Running Pod
- Executing commands inside a pod (`kubectl exec`)
- Port-forwarding to access services locally (`kubectl port-forward`)

## Understanding Pod Lifecycle
- Phases: Pending, Running, Succeeded, Failed, Unknown
- Pod restarts and termination

## Introduction to Manifests
- What is a Kubernetes manifest?
- YAML syntax overview
- Declarative configuration vs imperative commands

## Creating a Pod with a Manifest
- Writing a simple pod YAML
- Using `kubectl apply -f` to create from a manifest
- Viewing and editing a live manifest (`kubectl edit`)

## Best Practices for Single-Container Pods
- Image versioning
- Resource requests and limits
- Readiness and liveness probes (brief intro)

<!--

Create the chapter specified by the user.

Use only the following images in examples:
- `ubuntu`
- `nginx`
- `wordpress`
- `mysql`

Assume the user is running Kubernetes locally (e.g., via MicroK8s or Minikube), and tailor all network-related explanations accordingly. Clearly highlight how the behavior differs from deployments on real cloud platforms.

Add new subsections where needed to improve structure or clarity.

Maintain fluent, pedagogical language while avoiding excessive use of bullet points.

Prefer oversimplifications to overly detailed explanations.
