# Single-Container Pods

Start by explaining the fundamentals of Pods in Kubernetes and how they compare to Docker containers.

Then, explain how to manage Pods (using the Ubuntu image) through imperative commands.

Next, transition to the declarative approach using YAML manifests.

Conclude by reflecting on when it’s better to use imperative commands versus declarative configuration.
