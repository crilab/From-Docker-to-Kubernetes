# Single-Container Pods

Assume the user has a basic understanding of Docker and is now looking to learn Kubernetes.

Start by explaining the fundamentals of Pods in Kubernetes and how they compare to Docker containers.

Then, explain how to manage Pods (using the Ubuntu image) through imperative commands.

Next, transition to the declarative approach using YAML manifests.

Conclude by reflecting on when it’s better to use imperative commands versus declarative configuration.

# ReplicaSets

<previous_chapter>User learned how to manage pods (using ubuntu image) through imperative and declerative commands</previous_chapter>

Start by explaining the fundamentals of ReplicaSets in Kubernetes and what they do.

Explain how ReplicaSets help with maintaining high availability for example webservers (image nginx) but point out LoadBalancer will be covered in later chapters.

You decide how to go further in the chapter (but make sure the user gets al least one example of how to create one)...

# Deployments

# Services

# Load Balancers

# Health Checks

# ConfigMaps

# Secrets

# Volumes

# Multi-Container Pods
