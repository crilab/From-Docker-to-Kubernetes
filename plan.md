# Single-Container Pods

Start by explaining the fundamentals of Pods in Kubernetes and how they compare to Docker containers.

Then, explain how to manage Pods (using the Ubuntu image) through imperative commands.

Next, transition to the declarative approach using YAML manifests.

Conclude by reflecting on when it’s better to use imperative commands versus declarative configuration.

# ReplicaSets

# Deployments

# Services

# Load Balancers

# Health Checks

# ConfigMaps

# Secrets

# Volumes

# Multi-Container Pods

# ClusterIP

# Network Policies

% From Docker to Kubernetes
% Christian Åberg

Create the chapter specified by the user.

Assume the user already has a good understanding of Docker and now wants to learn Kubernetes.

Assume the user is running Kubernetes locally (e.g., via MicroK8s or Minikube), and tailor all network-related explanations accordingly. Clearly highlight how the behavior differs from deployments on real cloud platforms.

Plan the subsections and subsubsections appropriately.

Maintain fluent, pedagogical language while avoiding excessive use of bullet points.

Prefer oversimplifications to overly detailed explanations.
